# Basic-Java-Projects
Many different java projects first created in 2018/2019 during my freshman and sophmore years of college. 

Much of this code is meant to serve as basic foundation in java solving various basic problems using the fundamentals of programing.

Many projects can still be updated to further expand usability!
